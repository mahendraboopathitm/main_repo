# 1. Introduction to Programming
## 1.1 Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts

Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform tasks. It allows humans to communicate with computers and solve problems effectively.

## Key Concepts:

## Variables:

Variables are like storage boxes in memory where data can be stored and accessed later.

Example: age = 20 stores the number 20 in the variable age.

## Data Types:

Every variable has a type that defines what kind of data it holds.

### Common types:

int → whole numbers (10, -5)

float → decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)

str → text ("Hello")

bool → True/False

### Loops:

Loops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again.

### Types: for loop (iterate over sequences), while loop (repeat while a condition is true).

### Conditionals:

Conditional statements let the program make decisions.

Types: if, elif, else.

# 2. Command Line Basics

## 2.1 Basic Command Line Navigation and Execution of Python Scripts

The command line (terminal or CMD) is a text-based interface to communicate with your computer.

### Basic Commands:

cd <folder> → change current directory

dir (Windows) → list files and folders

pwd → print the current directory path

## 2.2 Essential Python Topics

Variables and Data Types

Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)

Loops (for, while)

Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets

# 3. Getting Started
## 3.1 Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and versatile programming language.

### Features of Python:

Simple and readable syntax

Supports multiple programming styles: procedural, object-oriented, and functional

Large library support for tasks like data analysis, web development, AI, and automation

Widely used in industry and academia

# 3.2 Installing Python

## Steps to install Python:

Visit Python official website

Download the latest version compatible with your system (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Run the installer and check “Add Python to PATH”

Verify installation in terminal/CMD

# 4. Python Basics
## 4.1 Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store information that can be used later in the program.

## 4.2 control flow statements:

### if statement
Checks the first condition (marks >= 90).
If true, executes the block and skips the rest.

### elif statements
Checked only if the previous if or elif was false.
Allows multiple conditions to be tested sequentially.

### else statement
Executes when none of the above conditions are true.
Acts as a fallback.

# 5.loop statements:

## For Loop

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times.

## while loop:

The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

The loop continues until the user enters 5.
Useful for programs requiring repeated user input until a condition is met
