# 1. Introduction to Programming
## 1.1 Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts

Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform tasks. It allows humans to communicate with computers and solve problems effectively.

## Key Concepts:

## Variables:

Variables are like storage boxes in memory where data can be stored and accessed later.

Example: age = 20 stores the number 20 in the variable age.

## Data Types:

Every variable has a type that defines what kind of data it holds.

## Common types:

int → whole numbers (10, -5)

float → decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)

str → text ("Hello")

bool → True/False

## Loops:

Loops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again.

## Types: for loop (iterate over sequences), while loop (repeat while a condition is true).

## Conditionals:

Conditional statements let the program make decisions.

Types: if, elif, else.
