# 1. Introduction to Programming
## 1.1 Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts

Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform tasks. It allows humans to communicate with computers and solve problems effectively.

## Key Concepts:

## Variables:

Variables are like storage boxes in memory where data can be stored and accessed later.

Example: age = 20 stores the number 20 in the variable age.

## Data Types:

Every variable has a type that defines what kind of data it holds.

### Common types:

int → whole numbers (10, -5)

float → decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)

str → text ("Hello")

bool → True/False

### Loops:

Loops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again.

### Types: for loop (iterate over sequences), while loop (repeat while a condition is true).

### Conditionals:

Conditional statements let the program make decisions.

Types: if, elif, else.

# 2. Command Line Basics

## 2.1 Basic Command Line Navigation and Execution of Python Scripts

The command line (terminal or CMD) is a text-based interface to communicate with your computer.

### Basic Commands:

cd <folder> → change current directory

dir (Windows) → list files and folders

pwd → print the current directory path

## 2.2 Essential Python Topics

Variables and Data Types

Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)

Loops (for, while)

Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets

# 3. Getting Started

# 4. Python Basics
## 4.1 Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store information that can be used later in the program.

## 4.2 control flow statements:

### if statement
Checks the first condition (marks >= 90).
If true, executes the block and skips the rest.

### elif statements
Checked only if the previous if or elif was false.
Allows multiple conditions to be tested sequentially.

### else statement
Executes when none of the above conditions are true.
Acts as a fallback.

# 5.loop statements:

## For Loop

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times.

<img width="1560" height="249" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 184259" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aaecbc4-f5c5-49dc-a565-98cf1afd95ac" />

## while loop:

The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

The loop continues until the user enters 5.
Useful for programs requiring repeated user input until a condition is met

# functions and datastructures
## list 

A list in Python is a collection of ordered, mutable (changeable), and indexed items.
Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Ordered – Elements maintain the order in which they are added.
Mutable – You can modify elements after creation.
Allow duplicates – Same value can appear more than once.
Heterogeneous – Can store different data types together.

## tuple

A tuple in Python is a collection of ordered and immutable elements.
It is similar to a list, but once created, the elements cannot be changed (no modification, addition, or deletion).

Ordered – Elements maintain the same sequence.
Immutable – You cannot modify elements once the tuple is created.
Allow duplicates – Same value can appear more than once.
Heterogeneous – Can store different data types.

## dictionaries

A dictionary in Python is a collection of key–value pairs.
It is unordered (in older versions), mutable, and indexed by keys.
Each key must be unique, and it is used to access the value associated with it.

Mutable – You can add, change, or remove items.
Unordered (before Python 3.7) – Now it maintains the insertion order.
Key–Value Mapping – Each value is accessed through its key.
Unique Keys – No duplicate keys allowed.
Dynamic – Can grow or shrink in size.

## set

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
It is mainly used when you want to store multiple items but don’t want duplicates.
Sets are mutable, but the elements inside must be immutable (like numbers, strings, or tuples).

Unordered – Items don’t have a fixed position or index.
Unique elements – Duplicate items are automatically removed.
Mutable – You can add or remove elements.
Heterogeneous – Can store different data types.
No indexing or slicing (because sets are unordered).

# file handling:

File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and delete files — so you can store data permanently (instead of just in memory).
 r'	Read mode (default). Opens file for reading. Error if file doesn’t exist.
'w'	Write mode. Creates new file or overwrites existing one.
'a'	Append mode. Adds data to the end of the file.
'x'	Create mode. Creates a new file; error if it already exists.
'r+'Read and write mode. File must exist.
'b'	Binary mode (for non-text files like images, PDFs, etc.).
't'	Text mode (default).

<img width="1351" height="543" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1593ddad-389c-48c9-ab29-23ed80e99dc8" />

# oops concepts:
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach that organizes code into objects — real-world entities that have data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Makes code reusable and organized
Easier to debug and maintain
Encourages modular programming
Allows data hiding (security)
Supports code reusability through inheritance

# class:

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
Think of it like a plan or design — for example:
A class is like a blueprint of a car (it describes what a car should have).
An object is a real car made using that blueprint.

The constructor is a special method in Python classes, named __init__().
It runs automatically whenever you create an object.

# inheritence:

Inheritance means one class can use the properties and methods of another class.
It helps in code reusability — you don’t need to write the same code again and again.
Inheritance improves code reusability.
Child class can override parent methods.
super() lets you access parent methods inside child class.
Avoid too deep inheritance chains — they make code harder to maintain.

# polymorphism:

Polymorphism means “many forms”.
In programming, it allows the same function or operator to work differently depending on the object or context.

Compile-time / Method Overloading (Python does not support traditional method overloading, but we can achieve it using default arguments)
Run-time / Method Overriding (most common in Python, using inheritance)

<img width="1390" height="848" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d28427-cd88-4703-8b59-fcdc52c096a7" />


# error_handling:

Error Handling is the process of catching and managing errors or exceptions that occur while a program runs.
Without error handling, your program stops abruptly if an error occurs. With error handling, you can gracefully handle errors and continue execution.

Always handle expected errors (like division by zero, file not found).
Use finally to release resources (like closing files).
Use raise to throw custom exceptions when needed.
Don’t use bare except: in production — catch specific exceptions.

# decorators:

A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and extends or modifies its behavior without changing the original function’s code.
Think of it like wrapping a gift: the wrapper adds extra features without changing what’s inside.
Add functionality to existing functions dynamically.
Avoid code repetition (e.g., logging, authentication, timing).
Keep code clean and maintainable.

# generators:

A generator is a special kind of function that produces items one at a time and does not store the entire sequence in memory.
Uses the yield keyword instead of return.
Pauses the function state and resumes on the next call.
Think of it as a lazy iterator

# lambda functions:

A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined without a name.
Can take any number of arguments but only one expression.
Automatically returns the value of the expression.
Often used with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().

<img width="1591" height="785" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 180747" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010b885e-fcce-47cf-9fd4-c0832bbf2458" />



# higher order functions:

A higher-order function is a function that can either:
Take another function as an argument, or
Return a function as a result
In simple words: functions that operate on other functions.
Makes code more modular and reusable.
Useful for functional programming.
Commonly used with lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce.

# unit testing:

Unit testing means testing individual parts (units) of your code — like a function or class — to check if they work correctly independently.
Think of it like checking each small machine part before assembling the full machine

Detect bugs early
Make code changes safely
Automate testing before deployment
Document intended behavior of your code
